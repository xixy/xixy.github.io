<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated from [Department of Automation](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University with a bachelor's degree, and from the [Knowledge Computing Lab](https://se.pku.edu.cn/kcl/), Peking University with a Phd's degree, advised by [Ye Wei (Âè∂Ëîö)](https://se.pku.edu.cn/kcl/weiye/). Now, I  am working at Meituan Group and focusing on task-oriented dialogue systems.

My research interest includes event extraction and dialogue systems. I have published more than 20 papers at the top international AI conferences including ACL, SIGIR, EMNLP, NAACL, CIKM, etc.
